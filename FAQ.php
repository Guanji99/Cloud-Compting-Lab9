        <br>
        <h3>WHY IS MY ORDER DELAYED</h3>
        <p>Currently, your order may experience fulfillment and shipping delays due to COVID-19 and government 
            restrictions. We are actively routing orders to the optimal facility for processing to ensure we 
            can get your order to you as quickly as possible.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>WHY IS MY CASHOUT DELAYED</h3>
        <p>Currently, your sales order may experience fulfillment and shipping delays due to COVID-19 and 
            government restrictions. We are actively routing orders to the optimal facility for processing 
            to ensure the quickest cashout, while maintaining the health and safety of our employees.</p>
        <h3>IS MY PACKAGE AND PRODUCT SAFE?</h3>
        <p>We understand that you may have concerns and the official <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.php" 
            style="color: blue;"><u>CDC FAQ page</u></a> has some helpful information regarding how 
            COVID-19 is transmitted, including:

            "In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely 
            very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or 
            weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by 
            respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated 
            with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with 
            imported goods. Information will be provided on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.php" 
            style="color: blue;"><u>Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website</u></a> as it becomes available."</p>
        <h3>CAN I CHANGE WHERE MY PACKAGE IS BEING SENT?</h3>
        <p>If the location you are sending your package to is temporarily closed and the item has not been 
            delivered, we will attempt to retrieve the package and place the item in SNKRHead storage for you. 
            With SNKRHead Storage you can temporarily store your shoes in our warehouse, and we will allow you to 
            resend the package to a different address or to the same address once the location reopens. You can 
            contact us by submitting a <a href="Contact us.html" style="color: blue;"><u>support request</u></a>.</p>
        <h3>COULD MY PACKAGE BE SENT TO/FROM A DIFFERENT FACILITY OR BY A DIFFERENT CARRIER THAN I’M USED TO SEEING?</h3>
        <p>Yes. To get orders to customers as quickly as possible, we may be making adjustments to our general 
            business operations.</p>
        <h3>ARE YOU STILL ACCEPTING DROP-OFFS?</h3>
        <p>To do our part in reducing the spread of COVID-19, we are temporarily closing our Seller Drop-Off 
            locations other than Malaysia.
            <br><br>If you have already selected Drop-Off, a shipping label will be emailed to you so you can 
            proceed with the order. Your cancellation window has also been extended 48 hours.
            <br><br>This update will not affect our standard Ship-to-Verify method, which will continue to operate as normal.
        </p>
        <h3>MY LISTINGS WERE PAUSED DUE TO UPDATES IN MY AREA. HOW CAN I RELIST?</h3>
        <p>At the moment you will not be able to relist items, activate any existing listings, or create new 
            listings. This is for the safety of sellers and to prevent invalid listings from being shown to 
            buyers. We will reach out to you again through email when anything changes.</p>
        <h3>I’M PROHIBITED FROM LEAVING MY HOME, BUT I RECENTLY SOLD SOMETHING AND NEED TO CANCEL. WILL I BE PENALIZED?</h3>
        <p>If we placed your account in “Vacation Mode” and you need to cancel, we will ensure that you do not 
            receive any negative score adjustments or commission increases.</p>
        <h3>WHY ARE MY LISTINGS NOT ACTIVE?</h3>
        <p>They are currently inactive because we have placed your account into a “Vacation Mode.”</p>
        <h3>WHEN WILL THINGS GO BACK TO NORMAL?</h3>
        <p>We are watching the conditions in your area closely. When we are ready to re-enable sellers to list, 
            we will let you know as soon as possible.</p>
        <h3>WHY CAN’T I TURN “VACATION MODE” OFF?</h3>
        <p>This is due to extenuating circumstances in your area. During this time you will be unable to turn off 
            “Vacation Mode.”</p>
        <h3>HOW CAN I ADJUST THE PRICE BEFORE “VACATION MODE” IS TURNED OFF?</h3>
        <p>We will notify you prior to removing “Vacation Mode,” and provide instructions on how to adjust prices 
            before the item goes live.</p>
        <h3>“VACATION MODE” HAS BEEN IMPOSED ON THE FOLLOWING POSTAL CODES AND REGIONS:</h3>
        <p>Region: Hong Kong <br><br>India: All postal codes</p>
